# Constraint-based modelling reveals a high carbon conversion efficiency in Marchantia polymorpha compared to that in C3 angiosperms

## Supplementary files 

Data 2.1 shows additional metabolites and reactions added to both models further to those in PlantCoreMetabolism_v1.2

Data 2.2 shows calculations to produce biomass stoichiometries for the Arabidopsis model

Data 2.3 shows calculations to produce biomass stoichiometries for the Marchantia model

Data 2.4 shows Python functions used to produce diel models

Data 2.5 is the Arabidopsis model

Data 2.6 is the Marchantia model

Data 2.7 and 2.8 show sensitivity analyses results for the Marchantia model at PPFDs of 95 and 174umol/m2/s respectively

Data 2.9 lists the non-overlapping fluxes between the Arabidopsis model at PPFD=120umol/m2/s and the Marchantia model at PPFD=174umol/m2/s
